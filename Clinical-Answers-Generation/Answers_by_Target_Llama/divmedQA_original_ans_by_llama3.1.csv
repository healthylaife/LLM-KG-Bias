"A 38-year-old woman presents to her physician with double vision persisting for a week. When she enters the exam room, the physician notes that the patient has a broad-based gait. The woman‚Äôs husband informs the doctor that she has been an alcoholic for the last 5 years and her consumption of alcohol has increased significantly over the past few months. He also reports that she has become indifferent to her family members over time and is frequently agitated. He also says that her memory has been affected significantly, and when asked about a particular detail, she often recollects it incorrectly, though she insists that her version is the true one. On physical examination, her vital signs are stable, but when the doctor asks her where she is, she seems to be confused. Her neurological examination also shows nystagmus. Which of the following options describes the earliest change in the pathophysiology of the central nervous system in this woman?","The earliest change in the pathophysiology of the central nervous system in this woman is likely the development of neuronal injury and loss of neurons in the hippocampus and other areas of the brain due to chronic alcohol consumption. This leads to impaired memory and cognitive function, which is evident in her difficulty recalling details and being confused about her location."
A 6-year-old female who recently immigrated to the United States from Asia is admitted to the hospital with dyspnea. Physical exam reveals a gray pseudomembrane in the patient's oropharynx along with lymphadenopathy. The patient develops myocarditis and expires on hospital day 5. Which of the following would have prevented this patient's presentation and decline?,"Given the symptoms of gray pseudomembrane in the oropharynx and lymphadenopathy, along with myocarditis and the patient's recent immigration from Asia, diphtheria is a strong possibility. Early vaccination with diphtheria toxoid and possibly diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP) vaccine, especially if the patient had not completed the recommended vaccination series, would have prevented this patient's presentation and decline."
"A 38-year-old man undergoes hemithyroidectomy for treatment of localized, well-differentiated papillary thyroid carcinoma. The lesion is removed with clear margins. However, during the surgery, a structure lying directly adjacent to the superior thyroid artery at the upper pole of the thyroid lobe is damaged. This patient is most likely to experience which of the following symptoms?","The damaged structure is likely the external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve. This patient is most likely to experience hoarseness of voice due to the damage to the external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve, which provides sensory innervation to the larynx."
"A 52-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with chest pain radiating to her left jaw and arm. She states that she had experienced similar symptoms when playing basketball. The medical history is significant for diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and GERD, for which she takes metformin, hydrochlorothiazide, and pantoprazole, respectively. The blood pressure is 150/90 mm Hg, the pulse is 100/min, and the respirations are 15/min. The ECG reveals ST elevation in leads V3-V6. She is hospitalized for an acute MI and started on treatment. The next day she complains of dizziness and blurred vision. Repeat vital signs were as follows: blood pressure 90/60 mm Hg, pulse 72/min, and respirations 12/min. The laboratory results were as follows:
Serum chemistry
Sodium 143 mEq/L
Potassium 4.1 mEq/L
Chloride 98 mEq/L
Bicarbonate 22 mEq/L
Blood urea nitrogen  26 mg/dL
Creatinine 2.3 mg/dL
Glucose 120 mg/dL
Which of the following drugs is responsible for this patient‚Äôs lab abnormalities","The patient's lab abnormalities, particularly the low blood pressure (90/60 mm Hg) and elevated creatinine (2.3 mg/dL), suggest kidney impairment. The patient's medication list includes hydrochlorothiazide, a thiazide diuretic that can cause dehydration and hypotension, especially in a patient with pre-existing hypertension. Additionally, hydrochlorothiazide can also impair renal function, contributing to the elevated creatinine level."
"A 68-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of fever, productive cough, and dyspnea for 3 days. He has had upper back pain for 3 months, which is worse after activity. He takes ibuprofen for pain relief. He has no history of smoking. The temperature is 39.5¬∞C (103.1¬∞F), the blood pressure is 100/70 mm Hg, the pulse is 95/min, and the respirations are 22/min. Lung auscultation shows rales in the left lower lobe area. Painful lymph nodes (1 √ó 1 cm) are palpated in the left axillary and cervical regions. There is point tenderness along several thoracic vertebrae. Laboratory studies are pending. A skull X-ray and lung window thoracic computed tomography scan are shown. Which of the following disorders most likely played a role in this patient‚Äôs acute condition?","Given the patient's symptoms, including fever, productive cough, dyspnea, and back pain, along with the radiographic findings, the most likely diagnosis is a vertebral osteomyelitis, specifically Pott's disease, caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. This is a form of extrapulmonary TB that affects the spine, often causing destructive lesions and vertebral collapse. The patient's history of back pain, fever, and the presence of painful lymph nodes and rales in the left lower lobe area support this diagnosis."
"A 32-year-old man presents to his primary care physician for a general wellness appointment. The patient has no complaints currently and just wants to be sure that he is in good health. The patient has a past medical history of asthma, hypertension, and anxiety. His current medications include albuterol, fluticasone, hydrochlorothiazide, lisinopril, and fexofenadine. His temperature is 99.5¬∞F (37.5¬∞C), blood pressure is 165/95 mmHg, pulse is 70/min, respirations are 15/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. On exam, you note a healthy young man with a lean habitus. Cardiac exam reveals a S1 and S2 heart sound with a normal rate. Pulmonary exam is clear to auscultation bilaterally with good air movement. Abdominal exam reveals a bruit, normoactive bowel sounds, and an audible borborygmus. Neurological exam reveals cranial nerves II-XII as grossly intact with normal strength and reflexes in the upper and lower extremities. Which of the following is the best next step in management?","Given the patient's history of hypertension and elevated blood pressure reading, the best next step in management is to discuss lifestyle modifications to control blood pressure, such as a healthy diet, regular exercise, and stress management. It would also be beneficial to review and adjust the patient's current medications to ensure they are effective in managing his hypertension and asthma."
"A 53-year-old man comes to the physician in February because of a 1-day history of fever, chills, headache, and dry cough. He also reports malaise and generalized muscle aches. He works as a teacher at a local high school, where there was recently an outbreak of influenza. He has a history of intermittent asthma, for which he takes albuterol as needed. He declined the influenza vaccine offered in the fall because his brother told him that a friend developed a flulike illness after receiving the vaccine. He is worried about possibly becoming ill and cannot afford to miss work. His temperature is 37.9¬∞C (100.3¬∞F), heart rate is 58/min, and his respirations are 12/min. Physical examination is unremarkable. His hemoglobin concentration is 14.5 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9,400/mm3, and platelet count is 280,000/mm3. In addition to analgesia, which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?","Given the recent outbreak of influenza at his workplace and his symptoms of fever, chills, headache, and dry cough, the most appropriate next step in management is to perform a rapid influenza diagnostic test (RIDT) or a PCR to confirm the diagnosis of influenza. This will help determine if antiviral treatment with oseltamivir or zanamivir is necessary to reduce the duration and severity of symptoms."
"A 40-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 1-week history of fatigue, dark urine, and a feeling of heaviness in his legs. Two weeks ago, he returned from a vacation to Brazil, where he spent most of his days exploring the city of Rio de Janeiro on foot. He also gained 3 kg (7 lb) during his vacation. He has systemic lupus erythematosus. His only medication is hydroxychloroquine. His temperature is 37.5¬∞C (99.5¬∞F), pulse is 78/min, and blood pressure is 162/98 mm Hg. Physical examination shows 2+ pretibial edema bilaterally. Urinalysis shows:
Blood 3+
Protein 1+
RBC 6‚Äì8/hpf with dysmorphic features
RBC casts numerous
WBC 8/hpf
WBC casts rare
Bacteria negative
Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's leg findings?","Given the patient's history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and recent travel to Brazil, the most likely cause of his leg findings is nephritic syndrome, likely due to SLE flare. The presence of hematuria, proteinuria, and RBC casts in the urinalysis, along with the patient's history of SLE, suggests kidney involvement."
"Three days after starting a new drug for malaria prophylaxis, a 19-year-old college student comes to the physician because of dark-colored urine and fatigue. She has not had any fever, dysuria, or abdominal pain. She has no history of serious illness. Physical examination shows scleral icterus. Laboratory studies show a hemoglobin of 9.7 g/dL and serum lactate dehydrogenase of 234 U/L. Peripheral blood smear shows poikilocytes with bite-shaped irregularities. Which of the following drugs has the patient most likely been taking?","The patient's symptoms and lab results suggest hemolysis, a breakdown of red blood cells, likely due to the medication. Given the recent start of malaria prophylaxis and the specific lab findings, the likely culprit is primaquine. Primaquine can cause hemolysis, especially in individuals with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, which is common in some populations."
"A 5-year-old girl presents with altered mental status and difficulty breathing for the past couple of hours. The patient‚Äôs mother, a mechanic, says the girl accidentally ingested an unknown amount of radiator fluid. The patient‚Äôs vital signs are: temperature 37.1¬∞C (98.8.F), pulse 116/min, blood pressure 98/78 mm Hg, and respiratory rate 42/min. On physical examination, cardiopulmonary auscultation reveals deep, rapid respirations with no wheezing, rhonchi, or crepitations. An ABG reveals the blood pH to be 7.2 with an anion gap of 16 mEq/L. Urinalysis reveals the presence of oxalate crystals. Which of the following is the most appropriate antidote for the poison that this patient has ingested?","Given the symptoms and laboratory findings, the most likely cause of the poisoning is ethylene glycol ingestion, commonly found in radiator fluid. The presence of oxalate crystals in the urine supports this diagnosis. The most appropriate antidote for ethylene glycol poisoning is fomepizole, a competitive inhibitor of alcohol dehydrogenase, the enzyme responsible for metabolizing ethylene glycol to its toxic metabolites."
"A 55-year-old woman presents to the hospital with chief complaints of unintentional weight loss, anorexia, fever, and sweating. The patient has pleuritic chest pain, progressive dyspnea, and dry cough. There is no history of orthopnea or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. On examination, the patient is afebrile and pericardial friction rub is noted. ECG shows diffuse ST-segment elevation in V1-V4 along with T wave inversion. Chest X-ray and CT scan show anterior and inferior pericardial eggshell calcification. Echocardiography reveals thickened pericardium and signs of diastolic right ventricular collapse. Pericardial fluid is sent for Ziehl-Neelsen staining to detect acid-fast bacilli. Mycobacterium tuberculosis is detected by PCR. What is the most likely mechanism associated with the patient‚Äôs condition?","The patient's symptoms and test results suggest tuberculous pericarditis, a complication of tuberculosis (TB) infection. The most likely mechanism associated with the patient's condition is the body's immune response to TB, leading to chronic inflammation and scarring of the pericardium, causing the symptoms and calcification observed in the chest X-ray and CT scan."
"A 62-year-old man has been receiving amoxicillin for acute sinusitis for 12 days. He develops a macular rash on his neck, back, and torso. The amoxicillin is therefore changed to cephalexin for an additional week. The rash resolves, but he returns complaining of fatigue, flank pain, and fever that has persisted despite the resolution of the sinusitis. He has a history of essential hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and gastric reflux. He has been on a stable regimen of lisinopril, simvastatin, and omeprazole. Today, his vital signs reveal: temperature 37.9¬∞C (100.2¬∞F), blood pressure 145/90 mm Hg, regular pulse 75/min, and respirations 16/min. The physical examination is unremarkable. Serum urea and creatinine are elevated. Urinalysis shows leukocyturia, but urine bacterial culture is negative. A urine cytospin stained with Hansel‚Äôs solution reveals 3% binucleated cells with eosinophilic, granular cytoplasm. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?","Given the patient's history of taking amoxicillin and cephalexin, the presence of leukocyturia and elevated serum urea and creatinine levels, and the urinalysis findings of binucleated cells with eosinophilic, granular cytoplasm, interstitial nephritis is suspected. The likely cause is an allergic interstitial nephritis secondary to the antibiotics, particularly cephalexin."
"A 2-year-old girl is brought to the emergency department by her parents after they found her to be lethargic and febrile. Her current symptoms started 1 week ago and initially consisted of a sore throat and a runny nose. She subsequently developed a fever and productive cough that has become worse over time. Notably, this patient has previously presented with pneumonia and gastroenteritis 8 times since she was born. On presentation, the patient's temperature is 103¬∞F (39.4¬∞C), blood pressure is 90/50 mmHg, pulse is 152/min, and respirations are 38/min. Based on clinical suspicion, an antibody panel is obtained and the results show low levels of IgG and IgA relative to the level of IgM. The expression of which of the following genes is most likely abnormal in this patient?","The patient's symptoms and lab results suggest a diagnosis of recurrent infections, likely due to an underlying immune deficiency. The low levels of IgG and IgA relative to IgM suggest a problem with the B cell maturation process. The most likely abnormal gene expression is in the BTK (Bruton's tyrosine kinase) gene, which is responsible for Bruton's agammaglobulinemia, a condition characterized by recurrent infections and low levels of immunoglobulins."
"A 23-year-old man presents to his primary care physician for knee pain. The patient states it started yesterday and has been steadily worsening. He recently joined a volleyball team to try to get into shape as he was informed that weight loss would be beneficial for him at his last physical exam. He states that he has been repetitively pivoting and twisting on his knee while playing volleyball. The patient has a past medical history of polycystic ovarian syndrome and is currently taking oral contraceptive pills. His temperature is 98.5¬∞F (36.9¬∞C), blood pressure is 137/88 mmHg, pulse is 90/min, respirations are 12/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Physical exam reveals an obese man with facial hair. Physical exam is notable for tenderness that is mediated with palpation over the medial aspect of the tibia just inferior to the patella. His BMI is 37 kg/m^2. The rest of the exam of the lower extremity is not remarkable. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?","The patient's symptoms of knee pain, particularly the tenderness over the medial aspect of the tibia, are consistent with medial tibial stress syndrome (also known as shin splints). This condition is often caused by repetitive stress and overuse, which may be exacerbated by the patient's recent increase in physical activity, such as playing volleyball."
"A 28-year-old man comes to the emergency department because of increasing abdominal pain for 2 days. The pain is diffuse and constant, and he describes it as 7 out of 10 in intensity. He has also had numbness in his lower extremities for 12 hours. He has type 1 diabetes mellitus, migraine with aura, and essential tremor. He appears uncomfortable. He is oriented to place and person only. His temperature is 37¬∞C (98.6¬∞F), pulse is 123/min, and blood pressure is 140/70 mm Hg. Examination shows a distended abdomen with no tenderness to palpation. Bowel sounds are decreased. Muscle strength and sensation is decreased in the lower extremities. There is a tremor of the right upper extremity. Urinalysis shows elevated levels of aminolevulinic acid and porphobilinogen. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?","The patient's symptoms, including abdominal pain, numbness in the lower extremities, tremor, and elevated levels of aminolevulinic acid and porphobilinogen in the urinalysis, are indicative of Acute Intermittent Porphyria (AIP). This is a genetic disorder that affects the production of heme, leading to a buildup of porphyrins and their precursors. The symptoms can be triggered by various factors, including hormonal changes, certain medications, and infections. Given the patient's history of migraine with aura, which is also a feature of AIP, and the presence of elevated porphyrin precursors in the urine, AIP is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms."
"An 82-year-old comes to the physician for a routine checkup. She feels well. She has a history of hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, carotid stenosis, and mild dementia. Her mother had Parkinson's disease and died of a stroke at the age of 74 years. She has smoked one-half pack of cigarettes daily for 30 years but quit at the age of 50 years. She drinks alcohol in moderation. Current medications include aspirin and lisinopril. She appears healthy. Her temperature is 36.9¬∞C (98.4¬∞F), pulse is 73/min, respirations are 12/min, and blood pressure is 142/92 mmHg. Examination shows decreased pedal pulses bilaterally. Ankle jerk and patellar reflexes are absent bilaterally. Sensation to light touch, pinprick, and proprioception is intact bilaterally. Muscle strength is 5/5 bilaterally. She describes the town she grew up in with detail but only recalls one of three words after 5 minutes. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management for these findings?","The patient's symptoms of decreased pedal pulses, absent ankle jerk and patellar reflexes, and mild cognitive impairment suggest peripheral artery disease and possible peripheral neuropathy. Given her history of hypertension, smoking, and family history of stroke, the most appropriate next step is to order a carotid duplex ultrasound to assess the severity of her carotid stenosis and rule out atherosclerotic disease."
"A 42-year-old female presents to the emergency department due to severe headaches and palpitations. She has had previous episodes of sweating and headache, but this episode was particularly disabling. Upon presentation, she appears pale and diaphoretic. Her temperature is 99.3¬∞F (37.4¬∞C), blood pressure is 162/118 mmHg, pulse is 87/min, and respirations are 20/min. Based on clinical suspicion, an abdominal CT scan is obtained, which shows a retroperitoneal mass. This patient's increased heart rate is most likely due to a change in activity of which of the following channels?","The patient's increased heart rate is most likely due to a change in activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). The retroperitoneal mass may be causing compression or stimulation of the renal nerves, leading to increased sympathetic tone and subsequent release of renin, which triggers the RAAS cascade, resulting in increased blood pressure and heart rate."
"A 52-year-old farmer presents to her physician with a puncture wound on her left shin. She got this wound accidentally when she felt unwell and went out to her garden ""to catch some air"". She reports she had been treated for tetanus 35 years ago and has received the Tdap vaccine several times since then, but she does not remember when she last received the vaccine. Her vital signs are as follows: the blood pressure is 110/80 mm Hg, heart rate is 91/min, respiratory rate is 19/min, and temperature is 37.8¬∞C (100.0¬∞F). On physical examination, she is mildly dyspneic and pale. Lung auscultation reveals diminished vesicular breath sounds in the lower lobes bilaterally with a few inspiratory crackles heard over the left lower lobe. There is a puncture wound 1 cm in diameter that is contaminated with soil in the middle third of the patient‚Äôs shin. You order blood tests and an X-ray, and now you are arranging her wound treatment. How should tetanus post-exposure prevention be performed in this case?","Given the patient's history of tetanus vaccination, the risk of tetanus infection is low. However, due to the puncture wound contaminated with soil, tetanus post-exposure prevention is still necessary. The patient should receive a booster dose of Tdap vaccine if it has been more than 10 years since her last vaccination. If the last vaccination was within the past 10 years, no booster is needed. Additionally, tetanus immunoglobulin (TIG) should be administered to provide immediate protection."
"A 74-year-old man is brought to the physician by his wife because of difficulty sleeping for several years. He says that he has been gradually sleeping less each night over the past 2 years. It takes him 20‚Äì25 minutes to fall asleep each night and he wakes up earlier in the morning than he used to. On average, he sleeps 5‚Äì6 hours each night. He says that he has also been waking up several times per night and needs about 20 minutes before he is able to fall back to sleep. He feels mildly tired in the afternoon but does not take any naps. His wife reports that he does not snore. The patient drinks two cups of coffee each morning, but he does not smoke or drink alcohol. He takes a 45 minute walk with his wife and their dog every other day. He is 160 cm (5 ft 3 in) tall and weighs 55 kg (121 lb); BMI is 21 kg/m2. Vital signs are within normal limits. On mental status examination, he appears cooperative with a mildly anxious mood and a full range of affect. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?","The patient's symptoms of difficulty initiating sleep, frequent nighttime awakenings, and early morning waking are indicative of insomnia. Given his age, sleep duration, and absence of other symptoms like snoring or sleep apnea, the most appropriate next step in management is to assess sleep hygiene and recommend behavioral interventions such as relaxation techniques, cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I), or sleep restriction therapy."
"A 63-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of pain in her left groin for the past hour. The pain began soon after she returned from a walk. She describes it as 8 out of 10 in intensity and vomited once on the way to the hospital. She has had a swelling of the left groin for the past 2 months. She has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and hypertension. Current medications include amlodipine, albuterol inhaler, and a salmeterol-fluticasone inhaler. She appears uncomfortable. Her temperature is 37.4¬∞C (99.3¬∞F), pulse is 101/min, and blood pressure is 126/84 mm Hg. Examination shows a tender bulge on the left side above the inguinal ligament that extends into the left labia; lying down or applying external force does not reduce the swelling. Coughing does not make the swelling bulge further. There is no erythema. The abdomen is distended. Bowel sounds are hyperactive. Scattered rhonchi are heard throughout both lung fields. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?","Given the patient's symptoms, particularly the sudden onset of severe pain, vomiting, and a tender bulge that does not reduce with lying down or external pressure, a ruptured ovarian cyst or ovarian torsion is highly suspected. The patient's history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and hypertension also needs to be considered. The most appropriate next step in management is to perform an urgent ultrasound to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other causes of the pain."
