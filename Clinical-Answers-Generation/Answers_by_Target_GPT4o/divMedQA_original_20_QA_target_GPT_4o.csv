"A 38-year-old woman presents to her physician with double vision persisting for a week. When she enters the exam room, the physician notes that the patient has a broad-based gait. The woman‚Äôs husband informs the doctor that she has been an alcoholic for the last 5 years and her consumption of alcohol has increased significantly over the past few months. He also reports that she has become indifferent to her family members over time and is frequently agitated. He also says that her memory has been affected significantly, and when asked about a particular detail, she often recollects it incorrectly, though she insists that her version is the true one. On physical examination, her vital signs are stable, but when the doctor asks her where she is, she seems to be confused. Her neurological examination also shows nystagmus. Which of the following options describes the earliest change in the pathophysiology of the central nervous system in this woman?","The symptoms described in this case, including double vision, broad-based gait, confusion, agitation, and memory issues, suggest Wernicke's encephalopathy, which is often associated with chronic alcoholism. The earliest change in the pathophysiology of the central nervous system in this condition is the depletion of thiamine (vitamin B1), leading to neuronal damage primarily in the thalamus and hypothalamus. This deficiency results in the classic triad of symptoms: confusion, ophthalmoplegia (including nystagmus), and ataxia."
A 6-year-old female who recently immigrated to the United States from Asia is admitted to the hospital with dyspnea. Physical exam reveals a gray pseudomembrane in the patient's oropharynx along with lymphadenopathy. The patient develops myocarditis and expires on hospital day 5. Which of the following would have prevented this patient's presentation and decline?,"This patient's presentation is consistent with diphtheria, caused by Corynebacterium diphtheriae. The most effective prevention for diphtheria is vaccination with the diphtheria toxoid vaccine, which is part of the DTaP (diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis) immunization schedule. Ensuring that this patient received the appropriate vaccinations would have likely prevented her illness and decline."
"A 38-year-old man undergoes hemithyroidectomy for treatment of localized, well-differentiated papillary thyroid carcinoma. The lesion is removed with clear margins. However, during the surgery, a structure lying directly adjacent to the superior thyroid artery at the upper pole of the thyroid lobe is damaged. This patient is most likely to experience which of the following symptoms?","Damage to the structure adjacent to the superior thyroid artery at the upper pole of the thyroid lobe is likely to involve the external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve. This nerve innervates the cricothyroid muscle, which is responsible for tension and elongation of the vocal cords. As a result, the patient is most likely to experience difficulty with high-pitched sounds or voice changes, such as hoarseness or a weak voice."
"A 52-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with chest pain radiating to her left jaw and arm. She states that she had experienced similar symptoms when playing basketball. The medical history is significant for diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and GERD, for which she takes metformin, hydrochlorothiazide, and pantoprazole, respectively. The blood pressure is 150/90 mm Hg, the pulse is 100/min, and the respirations are 15/min. The ECG reveals ST elevation in leads V3-V6. She is hospitalized for an acute MI and started on treatment. The next day she complains of dizziness and blurred vision. Repeat vital signs were as follows: blood pressure 90/60 mm Hg, pulse 72/min, and respirations 12/min. The laboratory results were as follows:
Serum chemistry
Sodium 143 mEq/L
Potassium 4.1 mEq/L
Chloride 98 mEq/L
Bicarbonate 22 mEq/L
Blood urea nitrogen  26 mg/dL
Creatinine 2.3 mg/dL
Glucose 120 mg/dL
Which of the following drugs is responsible for this patient‚Äôs lab abnormalities","The patient's symptoms and lab abnormalities, particularly the elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels, suggest acute kidney injury. Given her history of diabetes and hypertension, it is likely that she was treated with an ACE inhibitor (like lisinopril) or an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) after her myocardial infarction. These medications can cause a decrease in renal perfusion, especially in the setting of acute myocardial infarction, leading to renal impairment. Thus, the drug responsible for her lab abnormalities is likely an ACE inhibitor or ARB."
"A 68-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of fever, productive cough, and dyspnea for 3 days. He has had upper back pain for 3 months, which is worse after activity. He takes ibuprofen for pain relief. He has no history of smoking. The temperature is 39.5¬∞C (103.1¬∞F), the blood pressure is 100/70 mm Hg, the pulse is 95/min, and the respirations are 22/min. Lung auscultation shows rales in the left lower lobe area. Painful lymph nodes (1 √ó 1 cm) are palpated in the left axillary and cervical regions. There is point tenderness along several thoracic vertebrae. Laboratory studies are pending. A skull X-ray and lung window thoracic computed tomography scan are shown. Which of the following disorders most likely played a role in this patient‚Äôs acute condition?","Given the symptoms of fever, productive cough, dyspnea, upper back pain, and the presence of painful lymph nodes, this patient may be experiencing a condition related to an infectious process, such as pneumonia or an abscess, potentially complicated by vertebral osteomyelitis or a spinal abscess."
"A 32-year-old man presents to his primary care physician for a general wellness appointment. The patient has no complaints currently and just wants to be sure that he is in good health. The patient has a past medical history of asthma, hypertension, and anxiety. His current medications include albuterol, fluticasone, hydrochlorothiazide, lisinopril, and fexofenadine. His temperature is 99.5¬∞F (37.5¬∞C), blood pressure is 165/95 mmHg, pulse is 70/min, respirations are 15/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. On exam, you note a healthy young man with a lean habitus. Cardiac exam reveals a S1 and S2 heart sound with a normal rate. Pulmonary exam is clear to auscultation bilaterally with good air movement. Abdominal exam reveals a bruit, normoactive bowel sounds, and an audible borborygmus. Neurological exam reveals cranial nerves II-XII as grossly intact with normal strength and reflexes in the upper and lower extremities. Which of the following is the best next step in management?","
Given the patient's elevated blood pressure of 165/95 mmHg, the best next step in management is to initiate or adjust antihypertensive therapy. Lifestyle modifications should also be discussed, including diet and exercise, to help manage his hypertension effectively."
"A 53-year-old man comes to the physician in February because of a 1-day history of fever, chills, headache, and dry cough. He also reports malaise and generalized muscle aches. He works as a teacher at a local high school, where there was recently an outbreak of influenza. He has a history of intermittent asthma, for which he takes albuterol as needed. He declined the influenza vaccine offered in the fall because his brother told him that a friend developed a flulike illness after receiving the vaccine. He is worried about possibly becoming ill and cannot afford to miss work. His temperature is 37.9¬∞C (100.3¬∞F), heart rate is 58/min, and his respirations are 12/min. Physical examination is unremarkable. His hemoglobin concentration is 14.5 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9,400/mm3, and platelet count is 280,000/mm3. In addition to analgesia, which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?","Given the patient's symptoms and recent exposure to an influenza outbreak, the most appropriate next step in management is to administer antiviral medication, such as oseltamivir (Tamiflu), especially since he is within the 48-hour window for effective treatment. This can help reduce the duration and severity of influenza if he is indeed infected."
"A 40-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 1-week history of fatigue, dark urine, and a feeling of heaviness in his legs. Two weeks ago, he returned from a vacation to Brazil, where he spent most of his days exploring the city of Rio de Janeiro on foot. He also gained 3 kg (7 lb) during his vacation. He has systemic lupus erythematosus. His only medication is hydroxychloroquine. His temperature is 37.5¬∞C (99.5¬∞F), pulse is 78/min, and blood pressure is 162/98 mm Hg. Physical examination shows 2+ pretibial edema bilaterally. Urinalysis shows:
Blood 3+
Protein 1+
RBC 6‚Äì8/hpf with dysmorphic features
RBC casts numerous
WBC 8/hpf
WBC casts rare
Bacteria negative
Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's leg findings?","The patient's symptoms of fatigue, dark urine, bilateral pretibial edema, and the urinalysis findings (especially the presence of RBC casts and dysmorphic RBCs) suggest acute glomerulonephritis. Given his history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), the most likely cause of his leg findings is lupus nephritis, which can lead to kidney inflammation and damage, resulting in the observed symptoms."
"Three days after starting a new drug for malaria prophylaxis, a 19-year-old college student comes to the physician because of dark-colored urine and fatigue. She has not had any fever, dysuria, or abdominal pain. She has no history of serious illness. Physical examination shows scleral icterus. Laboratory studies show a hemoglobin of 9.7 g/dL and serum lactate dehydrogenase of 234 U/L. Peripheral blood smear shows poikilocytes with bite-shaped irregularities. Which of the following drugs has the patient most likely been taking?","The patient's symptoms of dark-colored urine, fatigue, scleral icterus, and the findings of poikilocytes with bite-shaped irregularities on the peripheral blood smear suggest hemolytic anemia, likely due to oxidative stress. This presentation is characteristic of G6PD deficiency, which can be triggered by certain medications.

The drug the patient has most likely been taking for malaria prophylaxis is primaquine, as it is known to cause hemolysis in individuals with G6PD deficiency."
"A 5-year-old girl presents with altered mental status and difficulty breathing for the past couple of hours. The patient‚Äôs mother, a mechanic, says the girl accidentally ingested an unknown amount of radiator fluid. The patient‚Äôs vital signs are: temperature 37.1¬∞C (98.8.F), pulse 116/min, blood pressure 98/78 mm Hg, and respiratory rate 42/min. On physical examination, cardiopulmonary auscultation reveals deep, rapid respirations with no wheezing, rhonchi, or crepitations. An ABG reveals the blood pH to be 7.2 with an anion gap of 16 mEq/L. Urinalysis reveals the presence of oxalate crystals. Which of the following is the most appropriate antidote for the poison that this patient has ingested?","The symptoms and laboratory findings, including altered mental status, respiratory distress, metabolic acidosis (pH 7.2), an elevated anion gap, and the presence of oxalate crystals in the urine, suggest ethylene glycol poisoning, commonly found in radiator fluid.

The most appropriate antidote for ethylene glycol poisoning is fomepizole. It acts as an alcohol dehydrogenase inhibitor, preventing the metabolism of ethylene glycol to its toxic metabolites. Alternatively, ethanol can also be used as an antidote."
"A 55-year-old woman presents to the hospital with chief complaints of unintentional weight loss, anorexia, fever, and sweating. The patient has pleuritic chest pain, progressive dyspnea, and dry cough. There is no history of orthopnea or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. On examination, the patient is afebrile and pericardial friction rub is noted. ECG shows diffuse ST-segment elevation in V1-V4 along with T wave inversion. Chest X-ray and CT scan show anterior and inferior pericardial eggshell calcification. Echocardiography reveals thickened pericardium and signs of diastolic right ventricular collapse. Pericardial fluid is sent for Ziehl-Neelsen staining to detect acid-fast bacilli. Mycobacterium tuberculosis is detected by PCR. What is the most likely mechanism associated with the patient‚Äôs condition?","The patient's condition is consistent with tuberculosis pericarditis, which is caused by infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The most likely mechanism is the inflammatory response to the infection, leading to thickening of the pericardium and the development of pericardial effusion. This results in symptoms such as chest pain, dyspnea, and the characteristic ECG changes."
"A 62-year-old man has been receiving amoxicillin for acute sinusitis for 12 days. He develops a macular rash on his neck, back, and torso. The amoxicillin is therefore changed to cephalexin for an additional week. The rash resolves, but he returns complaining of fatigue, flank pain, and fever that has persisted despite the resolution of the sinusitis. He has a history of essential hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and gastric reflux. He has been on a stable regimen of lisinopril, simvastatin, and omeprazole. Today, his vital signs reveal: temperature 37.9¬∞C (100.2¬∞F), blood pressure 145/90 mm Hg, regular pulse 75/min, and respirations 16/min. The physical examination is unremarkable. Serum urea and creatinine are elevated. Urinalysis shows leukocyturia, but urine bacterial culture is negative. A urine cytospin stained with Hansel‚Äôs solution reveals 3% binucleated cells with eosinophilic, granular cytoplasm. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?","The patient's symptoms of fatigue, flank pain, fever, elevated serum urea and creatinine, along with the presence of eosinophils in the urine, suggest acute interstitial nephritis. This condition is often associated with drug reactions, particularly to medications like antibiotics. Given the recent use of amoxicillin and cephalexin, the most likely diagnosis is drug-induced acute interstitial nephritis."
"A 2-year-old girl is brought to the emergency department by her parents after they found her to be lethargic and febrile. Her current symptoms started 1 week ago and initially consisted of a sore throat and a runny nose. She subsequently developed a fever and productive cough that has become worse over time. Notably, this patient has previously presented with pneumonia and gastroenteritis 8 times since she was born. On presentation, the patient's temperature is 103¬∞F (39.4¬∞C), blood pressure is 90/50 mmHg, pulse is 152/min, and respirations are 38/min. Based on clinical suspicion, an antibody panel is obtained and the results show low levels of IgG and IgA relative to the level of IgM. The expression of which of the following genes is most likely abnormal in this patient?","The patient's symptoms and history suggest a possible immunodeficiency, specifically a class-switching defect leading to low levels of IgG and IgA with normal IgM. This is characteristic of Hyper-IgM syndrome, which is often caused by a mutation in the CD40 ligand (CD40L) gene. This gene is crucial for class switching in B cells, leading to the observed immunological profile."
"A 23-year-old man presents to his primary care physician for knee pain. The patient states it started yesterday and has been steadily worsening. He recently joined a volleyball team to try to get into shape as he was informed that weight loss would be beneficial for him at his last physical exam. He states that he has been repetitively pivoting and twisting on his knee while playing volleyball. The patient has a past medical history of polycystic ovarian syndrome and is currently taking oral contraceptive pills. His temperature is 98.5¬∞F (36.9¬∞C), blood pressure is 137/88 mmHg, pulse is 90/min, respirations are 12/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Physical exam reveals an obese man with facial hair. Physical exam is notable for tenderness that is mediated with palpation over the medial aspect of the tibia just inferior to the patella. His BMI is 37 kg/m^2. The rest of the exam of the lower extremity is not remarkable. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?","The patient's knee pain, particularly tenderness over the medial aspect of the tibia just inferior to the patella, along with his recent increase in physical activity and obesity, suggests patellar tendinopathy (also known as jumper's knee). This condition is common in individuals who engage in sports that involve repetitive jumping or pivoting, leading to overuse of the patellar tendon."
"A 28-year-old man comes to the emergency department because of increasing abdominal pain for 2 days. The pain is diffuse and constant, and he describes it as 7 out of 10 in intensity. He has also had numbness in his lower extremities for 12 hours. He has type 1 diabetes mellitus, migraine with aura, and essential tremor. He appears uncomfortable. He is oriented to place and person only. His temperature is 37¬∞C (98.6¬∞F), pulse is 123/min, and blood pressure is 140/70 mm Hg. Examination shows a distended abdomen with no tenderness to palpation. Bowel sounds are decreased. Muscle strength and sensation is decreased in the lower extremities. There is a tremor of the right upper extremity. Urinalysis shows elevated levels of aminolevulinic acid and porphobilinogen. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?","The patient's symptoms, including abdominal pain, numbness in the lower extremities, and the presence of elevated levels of aminolevulinic acid and porphobilinogen in the urine, suggest an acute attack of acute intermittent porphyria. This condition is caused by a deficiency in the enzyme porphobilinogen deaminase, leading to the accumulation of porphyrin precursors. The patient's abdominal pain and neurological symptoms are consistent with this condition, which can be triggered by factors such as certain medications, hormonal changes, or fasting."
"An 82-year-old comes to the physician for a routine checkup. She feels well. She has a history of hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, carotid stenosis, and mild dementia. Her mother had Parkinson's disease and died of a stroke at the age of 74 years. She has smoked one-half pack of cigarettes daily for 30 years but quit at the age of 50 years. She drinks alcohol in moderation. Current medications include aspirin and lisinopril. She appears healthy. Her temperature is 36.9¬∞C (98.4¬∞F), pulse is 73/min, respirations are 12/min, and blood pressure is 142/92 mmHg. Examination shows decreased pedal pulses bilaterally. Ankle jerk and patellar reflexes are absent bilaterally. Sensation to light touch, pinprick, and proprioception is intact bilaterally. Muscle strength is 5/5 bilaterally. She describes the town she grew up in with detail but only recalls one of three words after 5 minutes. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management for these findings?","Given the patient's history of peripheral vascular disease, decreased pedal pulses, absent ankle and patellar reflexes, and her mild dementia, it is important to further evaluate her cognitive function. The most appropriate next step in management is to perform a cognitive assessment, such as the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) or another standardized cognitive test to evaluate her memory and cognitive abilities more thoroughly. This will help determine the extent of her cognitive impairment and guide further management."
"A 42-year-old female presents to the emergency department due to severe headaches and palpitations. She has had previous episodes of sweating and headache, but this episode was particularly disabling. Upon presentation, she appears pale and diaphoretic. Her temperature is 99.3¬∞F (37.4¬∞C), blood pressure is 162/118 mmHg, pulse is 87/min, and respirations are 20/min. Based on clinical suspicion, an abdominal CT scan is obtained, which shows a retroperitoneal mass. This patient's increased heart rate is most likely due to a change in activity of which of the following channels?","The patient's symptoms, including severe headaches, palpitations, and high blood pressure, along with the presence of a retroperitoneal mass, suggest the possibility of a pheochromocytoma. This tumor secretes catecholamines (such as epinephrine and norepinephrine), leading to increased heart rate and hypertension.

The increased heart rate is most likely due to a change in activity of adrenergic receptors, specifically the activation of beta-adrenergic receptors. Catecholamines bind to these receptors, increasing heart rate and contractility."
"A 52-year-old farmer presents to her physician with a puncture wound on her left shin. She got this wound accidentally when she felt unwell and went out to her garden ""to catch some air"". She reports she had been treated for tetanus 35 years ago and has received the Tdap vaccine several times since then, but she does not remember when she last received the vaccine. Her vital signs are as follows: the blood pressure is 110/80 mm Hg, heart rate is 91/min, respiratory rate is 19/min, and temperature is 37.8¬∞C (100.0¬∞F). On physical examination, she is mildly dyspneic and pale. Lung auscultation reveals diminished vesicular breath sounds in the lower lobes bilaterally with a few inspiratory crackles heard over the left lower lobe. There is a puncture wound 1 cm in diameter that is contaminated with soil in the middle third of the patient‚Äôs shin. You order blood tests and an X-ray, and now you are arranging her wound treatment. How should tetanus post-exposure prevention be performed in this case?","Given the patient's history of receiving the Tdap vaccine several times but not knowing when she last received it, and considering the contaminated puncture wound, she should receive a booster dose of the Tdap vaccine if it has been more than 10 years since her last booster. Additionally, if she has not received a tetanus booster in the last 5 years, she should receive one as a precaution. It's also important to clean and properly manage the wound to prevent infection."
"A 74-year-old man is brought to the physician by his wife because of difficulty sleeping for several years. He says that he has been gradually sleeping less each night over the past 2 years. It takes him 20‚Äì25 minutes to fall asleep each night and he wakes up earlier in the morning than he used to. On average, he sleeps 5‚Äì6 hours each night. He says that he has also been waking up several times per night and needs about 20 minutes before he is able to fall back to sleep. He feels mildly tired in the afternoon but does not take any naps. His wife reports that he does not snore. The patient drinks two cups of coffee each morning, but he does not smoke or drink alcohol. He takes a 45 minute walk with his wife and their dog every other day. He is 160 cm (5 ft 3 in) tall and weighs 55 kg (121 lb); BMI is 21 kg/m2. Vital signs are within normal limits. On mental status examination, he appears cooperative with a mildly anxious mood and a full range of affect. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?","Given the patient's difficulty sleeping, early morning awakenings, and mild anxiety, the most appropriate next step in management is to conduct a sleep assessment. This may include discussing sleep hygiene practices and possibly a sleep diary to track patterns. If the issues persist, further evaluation for potential sleep disorders, such as insomnia or sleep apnea, may be warranted."
"A 63-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of pain in her left groin for the past hour. The pain began soon after she returned from a walk. She describes it as 8 out of 10 in intensity and vomited once on the way to the hospital. She has had a swelling of the left groin for the past 2 months. She has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and hypertension. Current medications include amlodipine, albuterol inhaler, and a salmeterol-fluticasone inhaler. She appears uncomfortable. Her temperature is 37.4¬∞C (99.3¬∞F), pulse is 101/min, and blood pressure is 126/84 mm Hg. Examination shows a tender bulge on the left side above the inguinal ligament that extends into the left labia; lying down or applying external force does not reduce the swelling. Coughing does not make the swelling bulge further. There is no erythema. The abdomen is distended. Bowel sounds are hyperactive. Scattered rhonchi are heard throughout both lung fields. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?","The patient presents with acute left groin pain and a tender bulge, suggesting a possible incarcerated or strangulated hernia, especially given the history of swelling in the groin. The most appropriate next step in management is to obtain an urgent surgical consultation for evaluation and potential surgical intervention, as this condition may require immediate treatment to prevent complications"
